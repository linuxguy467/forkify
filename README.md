# forkify
Forkify project (Made by Matthew Hemingway).
Based on the original project by [Jonas Schmedtmann](http://codingheroes.io/)'s [The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course) on Udemy

## About
This is a cookbook application that contains recipes for multiple different foods within categories. The user will then select the food he/she likes and the recipe view will be shown with much more details. The user will then be able to add the necessary ingredients to shopping cart (*NOT YET IMPLEMENTED*).

* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - package manager tool used to get dependencies for app.

## How to run
__Make sure that Node.js and NPM are installed first by running `node -v` and `npm -v`__
